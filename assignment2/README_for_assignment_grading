Poisson problem code readme for grading
------------------------------------------------

Most important files with code changes:

main.c - changes added to include matrix initialization, memory de-allocation and function calls to methods

init.c, init.h - matrix initialization with 3 methods: sequential, parallel for Jacobi,
    parallel for Gauss-Seidel. The only difference between the last two 
    is the parameter in schedule(static)

jacobi.c, jacobi.h - 4 Jacobi methods created: sequential, 2 parallel 
    and one non-working version that was checked together with a few TAs
    and nobody could find an error.

gauss_seidel.c, gauss_seidel.h - 3 Gauss-Seidel methods created: sequential and 2 parallel

Makefile - added flags for openmp, prepared for use with gcc compiler


Short description of current setup
----------------------------------
Currently, main file is set up so that the most "advanced" versions of functions are called, 
either Jacobi parallel with while inside the parallel region together with initialization parallelized 
or same version but for Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

To change the setup, one has to uncomment desired lines of code in the main file, 
per instructions in the file.

Currently, algorithm prints information about 3 parameters in a descriptive manner: 
number of executed iterations, "tolerance" parameter that defines the change between last two iterations 
and execution time of just the method alone. 
It is possible to change the printed parameters to be just numbers without description, by uncommenting a line in main.c

IMPORTANT - In currently chosen version of Gauss-Seidel algorithm, the tolerance parameter will not return true value 
as it is not calculated in any of the parallel versions of this method.
